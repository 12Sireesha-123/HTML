<p>Arunachala pradesh</p>

It was here that sage Parashuram washed away his sin, sage Vyasa meditated, King Bhishmaka founded his kingdom and Lord Krishna married his consort Rukmini.

There are places of worship and pilgrimage such as the Parasuramkund and the 400‑year‑old Tawang Monastery, or the sites of archaeological excavations like Malinithan and Itanagar, the natural environment of lakes such as Ganga lake or Sela lake or the numerous variations of the snow-clad silver mountain peaks and green meadows where thousands of species of flora and fauna prosper. In addition, the state provides abundant scope for angling, boating, rafting, trekking, and hiking. There are a number of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks with rare animals, birds, and plants.

The climate varies from hot and humid to heavy rainfall in the Shivalik range. It becomes progressively colder further northward to higher altitudes. Trees of great size, plentiful climbers, and an abundance of cane and bamboo make Arunachal evergreen. Arunachal Pradesh is home to more than six hundred species of orchids, occurring in varying elevations and climatic conditions throughout the state.</p1>

The Goa Carnival is a world-famous event, with colorful masks and floats, drums and reverberating music, and dance performances.</p1>
<p>Kerala</p>
<p1>Kerala is a state on the tropical Malabar Coast of south-western India. Nicknamed one of the "10 paradises of the world" by National Geographic,[31] Kerala is famous especially for its eco-tourism initiatives. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made it one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. Growing at a rate of 13.31%, the tourism industry significantly contributes to the state's economy. Kerala is known for its tropical backwaters, especially in Alappuzha, Kochi and Kuttanadu. The beaches in Trivandrum such as Kovalam and Varkala are also popular. In recent years, many other beaches in Kerala such as Fort Kochi and Cherai beach attract many local and foreign tourists. Munnar is the most visited hill station in Kerala.<br><br>

From the greenscapes of Idukki to cities like Trivandrum and Kochi, Kerala has a large collection of tourist spots. Popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Varkala, Cherai, Kappad and Muzhappilangad. The Fort Kochi Beach is one of the most visited beach by foreigners even though it is not used much for swimming. The hill stations of Munnar, Thekkady, Ramakkalmedu Nelliampathi, Ponmudi and Wayanad are very popular. The forts like the Bekal Fort in Kanhangad and St. Angelo's Fort in Kannur and the National Parks/ Wildlife sanctuaries at Periyar and Eravikulam attract a lot of local and foreign tourists. The "backwaters" region, an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Alleppey, Kumarakom, and Punnamada, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as East Fort, Kuthira Malika, Hill Palace, Mattancherry Palace are also famous. Cities such as Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode and Kollam are popular centres for shopping and traditional theatrical performance.<br><br>

Kerala has a very rich history. The oldest Synagogue outside the middle east is in Kerala. The oldest Christian churches in Indian subcontinent is in Kerala. The oldest mosque in Indian subcontinent is in Kerala.<br><br>

The Grand Kerala Shopping Festival (GKSF) claimed to be Asia's largest shopping festival and began in 2007.[32] Since then it has been conducted in December and January. During this period, stores and shops registered under the GKSF offer a wide range of discounts, vat refunds etc. Along with the shopping experience, shoppers are provided with gift coupons for a fixed value of purchase entering them into weekly and mega lucky draws. As compared to shopping festivals being held in other countries, this Festival converts the entire state of Kerala into a giant shopping mall, and includes both large and small businesses.<br><br>

The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population. Efforts are taken to minimise the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment, and enhance the cultural integrity of local people.
